Developed an intelligent Pacman agent to find goal states based on heuristic calculations for search algorithms -dfs,bfs and A* search in Python.

It the search file of pacman includes the implementation of the following scenarios:
 
1) Finding a fixed dot food using Depth-first search

2) Finding a fixed dot food using Breadth-first search

3) Implementing uniform cost search

4) Implementing A* search

5) Finding all the corners of the pacman board

6) Calculating admissible and consistent heuristics to find the corners 

7) Calculating admissible and consistent heuristics to eat all the food dots present in the problem

8) Suboptimal search for finding the closest dot agent
